- How to Configure Deployment through ArgoCD:

# Set up ArgoCD:

Ensure that ArgoCD is installed and running in your GKE cluster.
Set up an ArgoCD application for your microservice that points to the Git repository or the Kubernetes manifest for your service.

# ArgoCD Application Setup:

You can define a Kubernetes YAML manifest for your microservice in the Git repository .
The ArgoCD application should watch the repository for changes in the manifest or image tags.
When a new image is pushed to GCR, the application syncs and updates the deployment in GKE with the new image.

# GitHub Secrets:

Store your GCP service account key (GCP_SA_KEY), project ID (GCP_PROJECT_ID), and ArgoCD credentials (ARGOCD_SERVER, ARGOCD_USERNAME, ARGOCD_PASSWORD) in GitHub Secrets for secure access.
